# Crypto RSI Alert Bot ðŸ“ˆðŸš€

**Crypto RSI Alert Bot** is a Python-based application that monitors the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of selected cryptocurrencies using the Binance API and sends email alerts when RSI values cross predefined thresholds. This helps traders stay informed about overbought or oversold conditions in real-time.

## Features

- ðŸ›  **Customizable RSI Thresholds**: Configure upper and lower RSI thresholds for alerts.
- ðŸ“Š **Supports Multiple Cryptocurrencies**: Track RSI values for pairs like BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, and more.
- ðŸ“­ **Email Notifications**: Receive consolidated email alerts for multiple coins that breach thresholds.
- ðŸ”„ **Continuous Monitoring**: Automatically checks RSI values every 45 seconds.
- ðŸ”’ **Free & Open-Source**: Completely free to use with no restrictions.

## How It Works

1. The app fetches RSI values for selected cryptocurrency pairs using the Binance API.
2. Compares the RSI values against user-defined thresholds:
   - **Overbought**: RSI exceeds the upper threshold.
   - **Oversold**: RSI falls below the lower threshold.
3. Sends a single email notification if one or more coins breach the thresholds.
4. Runs continuously, checking RSI values every 45 seconds.
